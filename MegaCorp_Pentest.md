# Challenges 16 &amp; 17: MegaCorpone/Offensive Security CTF

## Objective Summary
This project highlights offensive security techniques practiced during the University of California, Irvine's Cybersecurity Boot Camp. It involved simulating penetration testing on the fictional MegaCorpone Corporation to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities within their web application, Linux servers, and Windows servers. The objective was to identify potential security weaknesses and demonstrate real-world offensive security methodologies.
 
## Project Highlights
Key Achievements:
- Conducted vulnerability assessments and penetration tests on MegaCorponeâ€™s web application.
- Exploited misconfigurations and weaknesses in Linux and Windows server environments.
- Delivered actionable security insights and recommendations based on findings.

### Technical Skills Gained
- Web Application Security:
   - Exploited vulnerabilities in web applications using tools like Burp Suite and Metasploit.
   - Applied OWASP principles to address web application threats.
- Server Security:
   - Conducted vulnerability scans and exploited misconfigurations on Linux and Windows servers.
   - Practiced privilege escalation to simulate full system compromise.
- Penetration Testing Methodology:
   - Followed the 5-step penetration testing process: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, and Covering Tracks.
   - Used the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to guide structured attack simulations.
- OSINT & Reconnaissance:
   - Utilized OSINT tools like OSINT Framework, Google, and GitHub for information gathering.

## Project Write up
### Summary
Scenario Overview: MegaCorpone is a fictional company . T Preparing for their business launch, MegaCorpone enlisted penetration testers to assess their web application, Linux, and Windows servers for vulnerabilities, ensuring their systems are secure before going live.

#### Web Application Vulnerability Testing:
1. Conducted reconnaissance using OSINT tools to gather data about the MegaCorpone web application.
2. Identified web application vulnerabilities using Burp Suite and Nmap/Zenmap.
3. Exploited discovered vulnerabilities using the Metasploit Framework.

#### Linux Server Penetration Testing:
1. Scanned Linux servers for vulnerabilities with Nmap and Nessus.
2. Identified misconfigurations and leveraged exploits via Metasploit.
3. Escalated privileges to simulate full system compromise.

#### Windows Server Penetration Testing:
1. Conducted initial scans to uncover vulnerabilities on Windows servers.
2. Created and deployed custom payloads using MsVenom.
3. Exploited services and tested for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
