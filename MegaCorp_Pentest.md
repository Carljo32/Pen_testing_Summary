# Challenges 16 &amp; 17: MegaCorpone/Offensive Security CTF

## Objective Summary
This project highlights offensive security techniques practiced during the University of California, Irvine's Cybersecurity Boot Camp. It involved simulating penetration testing on the fictional MegaCorpone Corporation to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities within their web application, Linux servers, and Windows servers. The objective was to identify potential security weaknesses and demonstrate real-world offensive security methodologies.
 
### Concise Project Highlights
Key Achievements:
- Conducted vulnerability assessments and penetration tests on MegaCorponeâ€™s web application.
- Exploited misconfigurations and weaknesses in Linux and Windows server environments.
- Delivered actionable security insights and recommendations based on findings.

## Technical Skills Learned
- Offensive security methodologies, including vulnerability identification and exploitation.
- Practical application of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework for attack simulations.
- Advanced use of tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, Nessus, and Burp Suite.
- Hands-on experience with OSINT techniques for reconnaissance and data gathering.
- Exploiting web applications and server misconfigurations in Linux and Windows environments.

## Tools, Techniques & Utilities Used
- Penetration Testing Methodology: 5-Step Process (Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, Covering Tracks).

#### Tools:
- OSINT Framework, Google, GitHub
- Nmap/Zenmap, Nessus (Vulnerability Scanning)
- Metasploit, MsVenom (Exploitation)
- Burp Suite (Web Application Testing)

#### Environments: 
- Hyper-V Manager, MegaCorpone Web Application, Azure Windows 10/WinDC VM


## Steps Taken to Complete the Project
### Summary:
#### Web Application Vulnerability Testing:
1. Conducted reconnaissance using OSINT tools to gather data about the MegaCorpone web application.
2. Identified web application vulnerabilities using Burp Suite and Nmap/Zenmap.
3. Exploited discovered vulnerabilities using the Metasploit Framework.

#### Linux Server Penetration Testing:
1. Scanned Linux servers for vulnerabilities with Nmap and Nessus.
2. Identified misconfigurations and leveraged exploits via Metasploit.
3. Escalated privileges to simulate full system compromise.

#### Windows Server Penetration Testing:
1. Conducted initial scans to uncover vulnerabilities on Windows servers.
2. Created and deployed custom payloads using MsVenom.
3. Exploited services and tested for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

### Detailed Steps: 
Scenario Overview: MegaCorpone is a fictional company providing immersive virtual reality experiences based on customer-submitted images. These experiences range from dream vacations to adrenaline-pumping adventures. Preparing for their business launch, MegaCorpone enlisted penetration testers to assess their web application, Linux, and Windows servers for vulnerabilities, ensuring their systems are secure before going live.
