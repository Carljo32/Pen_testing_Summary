# Project 2: Rekall Corp./Offensive Security CTF</h1>

## Objective Summary
This project highlights offensive security techniques practiced during the University of California, Irvine's Cybersecurity Boot Camp. It involved simulating penetration testing on the fictional MegaCorpone Corporation to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities within their web application, Linux servers, and Windows servers. The objective was to identify potential security weaknesses and demonstrate real-world offensive security methodologies.
 
## Project Highlights
Key Achievements:
- Conducted penetration testing on Rekall's web application, Linux, and Windows servers.
- Identified critical vulnerabilities and simulated exploits to assess their impact.
- Delivered actionable remediation strategies to enhance Rekall's security posture.

### Technical Skills Gained
- Web Application Security:
   - Exploited web application vulnerabilities using tools like Burp Suite and Metasploit.
   - Gained hands-on experience in identifying OWASP Top 10 risks.
- Server Security:
   - Performed vulnerability scans and privilege escalation on Linux and Windows servers.
   - Explored common misconfigurations and server-specific exploits.
- Penetration Testing Methodology:
   - Followed a structured 5-step penetration testing process: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Exploitation, Persistence, and Covering Tracks.
   - Mapped exploits using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- OSINT & Reconnaissance:
   - Leveraged tools like OSINT Framework, Google, and GitHub for information gathering.

## Project Write up
### Summary
Scenario Overview: Rekall Corporation is a fictional company offering personalized virtual reality experiences based on customer-uploaded images. These experiences range from dream vacations to secret missions, designed to feel incredibly real. Before launching their business, Rekall hired penetration testers to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in their web applications and server infrastructure, ensuring a secure platform for their customers.

#### Web Application Vulnerability Testing:
1. Conducted reconnaissance using OSINT tools to gather data about the Rekall Corporation web application.
2. Identified web application vulnerabilities using Burp Suite and Nmap/Zenmap.
3. Exploited discovered vulnerabilities using the Metasploit Framework.

#### Linux Server Penetration Testing:
1. Scanned Linux servers for vulnerabilities with Nmap and Nessus.
2. Identified misconfigurations and leveraged exploits via Metasploit.
3. Escalated privileges to simulate full system compromise.

#### Windows Server Penetration Testing:
1. Conducted initial scans to uncover vulnerabilities on Windows servers wtih Nmap.
2. Created and deployed custom payloads using Metasploit and MsVenom.
3. Exploited services and tested for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

### Summary of Findings and Remediation Strategies
Findings:
1. Web application vulnerable to SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. Linux servers exposed due to weak SSH configurations and outdated software.
3. Windows servers at risk from misconfigured services and lack of proper access controls.

Remediation Strategies:
1. Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
2. Update server software and enforce strong SSH authentication policies.
3. Apply least privilege access controls and secure Windows server configurations.
