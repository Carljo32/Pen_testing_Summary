# Project 2: Rekall Corp./Offensive Security CTF</h1>

## Description
This project showcases the offensive security skills I developed during the University of California, Irvine's cybersecurity bootcamp. It involved attacking the fictional Rekall Corporation to identify and exploit various web and server vulnerabilities. 

## Timeline
 <li>Day 1: Identified and exploited vulnerabilities on Rekall's web application.</li>
 <li>Day 2: Identified and exploited vulnerabilities on Rekall's Linux servers.</li>
 <li>Day 3: Identified and exploited vulnerabilities on Rekall's Windows servers.</li>


## Security Tools, Techniques & Utilities Used:

 <li>Penetration testing methodology: 5 Step process....</li>
 <li>MITRE framework</li>
 <li>OSINT tools like ointframework.com, google, and GitHub</li>
 <li>Metasploit framework</li>
 <li>MsVenom</li>
 <li>Vulnerability scanning with Nmap/Zenmap and Nessus</li>
 <li>Burp Suite</li>


## Environments Used
<li> Hyper-V Manager</li>
<li> Rekall Web Application</li>
<li> Azure Windows 10 / WinDC VM </li>


## Project Scenario
<ul>
 <li>Rekall Corporation is a fictional company that specializes in offering virtual reality experiences based on images that customers upload.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>These experiences could include dream vacations, adventures, or even secret missions.</li>
  <li>Rekall guarantees that these virtual reality experiences will feel real.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Rekall is about to go live with their business, and they need penetration testers to find any vulnerabilities within their technical systems.</li>
 <ul>
