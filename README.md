# Penetration Testing Summary Reports
##### UCI's Cybersecurity Boot Camp Project #2

This repository is meant to demonstrate my offensive security projects during UCI’s Cybersecurity Boot Camp.

In the MegaCorpOne project, I conducted a two-week penetration test, uncovering vulnerabilities in web applications, Linux servers, Windows workstations, and Domain Controllers. For the Rekall Corporation project, I completed a focused three-day assessment, identifying security weaknesses and providing actionable remediation strategies.

These projects highlight my hands-on experience in penetration testing and my commitment to strengthening cybersecurity defenses.

This file is my final submission of the challenge assignment for Modules 16 &amp; 17 of UCI's Cybersecurity  Bootcamp.

For this assignment, I conducted a mock penetration test on the fictional corporation, MegaCorpOne. Over two weeks, I explored and attempted to exploit a web application, Linux servers, a Windows workstation, and a Windows Domain Controller. At the end of the testing period, I prepared a report for MegaCorpOne’s management to summarize my findings.

In my report, I outlined the vulnerabilities I discovered and offered recommended remediation strategies to address each identified security weakness.

This file is the final submission for Project 2 of UCI's Cybersecurity  Bootcamp.

For Project 2, I conducted a mock penetration test on the fictional Rekall Corporation over a three-day period. During this test, I assessed a web application, Linux servers, a Windows workstation, and a Windows Domain Controller. At the end of the testing phase, I prepared a detailed report for Rekall Corporation’s management summarizing my findings.

In the report, I identified the vulnerabilities discovered and provided recommended remediation strategies for each security weakness.
