# Penetration Testing Summary Reports

## MegaCorpOne Penetration Test Report

This file is my final submission of the challenge assignment for Modules 16 &amp; 17 of UCI's Cybersecurity  Bootcamp.

For this assignment, I conducted a mock penetration test on the fictional corporation, MegaCorpOne. Over two weeks, I explored and attempted to exploit a web application, Linux servers, a Windows workstation, and a Windows Domain Controller. At the end of the testing period, I prepared a report for MegaCorpOne’s management to summarize my findings.

In my report, I outlined the vulnerabilities I discovered and offered recommended remediation strategies to address each identified security weakness.



## Rekall Corporation Penetration Test Report

This file is the final submission for Project 2 of UCI's Cybersecurity  Bootcamp.

For Project 2, I conducted a mock penetration test on the fictional Rekall Corporation over a three-day period. During this test, I assessed a web application, Linux servers, a Windows workstation, and a Windows Domain Controller. At the end of the testing phase, I prepared a detailed report for Rekall Corporation’s management summarizing my findings.

In the report, I identified the vulnerabilities discovered and provided recommended remediation strategies for each security weakness.
